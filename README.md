# My very first website

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net

This project was built as I learned how to use Gitpod and GitHub for the first time.

I created files and folders, renamed them, copied and moved them using commands in the terminal.

This was my first time using an IDE to write code and entering commands in the terminal.

I created a very simple static website using html and css.


FEATURES:

The website consists of three pages, each page having images of common development tools and a working link which goes to each wikipedia page.

A navigation bar at the top of each page allows the user to move between pages without having to utilise the 'back' button.


SUMMARY:

This project was saved to a repository on GitHub and published to GitHub pages.
