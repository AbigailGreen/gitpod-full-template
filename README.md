# My very first website

# Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

This project was built as I learned how to use **Gitpod** and **GitHub** for the first time during my software development course.

I created files and folders, renamed them, copied and moved them using commands in the terminal.

This was my first time using an **IDE** to write code and entering commands in the terminal.

I created a very simple static website using *html* and *CSS*.

_Markdown_ was used to write this **README** file.

## FEATURES:

The website consists of three pages, each page having images of common development tools and a working link which goes to each wikipedia page.

A navigation bar at the top of each page allows the user to move between pages without having to utilise the 'back' button.

## SUMMARY:

I wrote the code and checked the website in browser. 

I performed a series of git add's, git commits and git pushes which resulted in this project wasbeing saved to a repository on GitHub, and then published to GitHub pages.
